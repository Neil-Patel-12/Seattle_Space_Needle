                    <h3>When and Why was it built? </h3>
                    <p>The construction started April 17,1961 and completed
                        December 1961. It was originally built for the World’s
                        Fair in 1962: Century 21 Exposition with theme “The Age of Space”.
                        The 1960s was the space race, which led the first astronauts landing
                        on the moon. The structure symbolized the humanity’s Space
                        Age aspirations.

                    <h3>Was it built using local materials? </h3>
                    <p>Material provided by the United States,
                        the massive base was made of cement that
                        equated to 467 cement trucks. The legs
                        of the Space Needle consist of three 36-inch-wide
                        flanged beams welded together flange-to-flange and
                        stiffened with diaphragms to form large three-sided
                        tubes. Recently, in 2017, glass and steel have been
                        added to increase strength and functionality.

                    <h3>How has it been used in the past? Always for its intended purpose or has it been adapted for
                        reuse by later generations? </h3>
                    <p>The Space Needle was originally intended for
                        the 21 Century Exposition – Seattle’s World Fair,
                        also sending a message to the world that our future
                        is in technology and space. Now, It houses two
                        restaurant, a radio station and offers 360- degree
                        views from its three main viewing areas: an indoor
                        observation deck, open air viewing area, and a level
                        featuring a revolving glass floor called “The Loupe”
                        at 500 feet above ground.
